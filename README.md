# Nintendo-Facts
First Android App!

Got bored this summer and decided to use what I learned in Java to develop a basic android app (first one). 

The app is pretty simple, just install the apk on to your phone or emulator and give it a shot!

Randomly generates a fact about nintendo + background color when the button is pressed.
